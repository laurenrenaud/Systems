# Processor Types

We can look at the processors' inventory types to as a way to classify those that were "uncategorized", as well as to double check our above classifications.

For about half of the inhalants, the processor also listed the product type as "Marijuana Extract for Inhalation", but for the other half, we have more detail about what went into the product. It also may be possible, if needed or useful, to try to go back one further step in the suppy chain to see what inventory types came before "Marijuana Extract for Inhalation" for a given product.

```{r processortypes, warning=FALSE}
# combinations of inventory types
process.types <- inhalants %>%
  # for some reason there is a very small number that are missing retail inventory type
  # that didn't wokr in the join correctly
  # screening these 70 out, but might investigate why
  filter(!is.na(retail_invtype)) %>%
  # group by processor's inventory type to get count and stats of the combinations
  group_by(process_invtype) %>%
  summarise(perc = round( n() / nrow(inhalants.joined)*100,1),
            count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

knitr::kable(process.types, col.names = c("Processor's Inventory Type - All Inhalants",
                                          "Percent of Inhalants",
                                          "Count"),
               align=c("r", "r", "r"))


process.types.uncategorized <- inhalants %>%
  # same as above, but restricted to inhalants that are uncategorized
  filter(!is.na(retail_invtype), uncategorized) %>%
  # get count of number of uncategorized
  mutate(total = n()) %>%
  group_by(process_invtype) %>%
  summarise(perc = round(n() / total[1] *100,1),
            count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

```

More excitingly, we should be able to classify an additional `r round(sum(process.types.uncategorized$perc[process.types.uncategorized$process_invtype!="Marijuana Extract for Inhalation" & process.types.uncategorized$process_invtype!="Food Grade Solvent Extract" & !is.na(process.types.uncategorized$process_invtype)]),1)`% of the inhalants that we were not able to categorized by product name and keywords by looking at the processor's listed inventory types. This should allow us to get our uncategorized products down to about `r round(sum(inhalants$uncategorized, na.rm=T) / nrow(inhalants) * (sum(process.types.uncategorized$perc[process.types.uncategorized$process_invtype!="Marijuana Extract for Inhalation" & process.types.uncategorized$process_invtype!="Food Grade Solvent Extract"], na.rm=T)/100)*100,1)`% of inhalants.

```{r processortypes2, warning=FALSE}

knitr::kable(process.types.uncategorized, col.names = c("Processor's Inventory Type - Only Uncategorized",
                                                        "Percent of Uncategorized",
                                                        "Count"),
             align=c("r", "r", "r"))

```

# Next Steps

 - Explore the still uncategorized extracts to see if they have any time, price, potency, etc trends
 - Explore the `r round(sum(num.keywords$distro_numkeywords[num.keywords$numCat>1]) / nrow(inhalantnames)*100,1)`% of overlapping keyword classifications and determine how to categorize them
 - Scatterplot of existing categories, possible cluster model, which may also help classify the uncategorized
 - Possibly aggregage back up into more generalized inhalant categories like "cartridge", "concentrate", "other", or something else that more generally captures either use-type, potency cluster, or both
 - Use these categories for futher analysis of the extract market
